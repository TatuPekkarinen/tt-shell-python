Minimal Python Shell

This project is a small command-line shell written in Python. It supports a few basic builtin commands and can also run executable files from the current directory. The goal is to provide a lightweight example of how a shell parses input and decides what to do with it.

Initially a codecrafters challenge I did without AI that includes a couple of differences to the initial challenge. Mostly made for me to tinker with like adding colorization making the file run commands as I actually need them to be alongside other commands that will be added.

LIST OF USABLE COMMANDS WITH EXAMPLES

    Exit - exits the program
        $ exit
        PS C:\Users\-\tt-shell\tt-shell> 

    Type - tells if the file is in the directory or if the command is builtin
        $ type cmd
        cmd is C:\Windows\system32\cmd.EXE
        
        $ type echo
        echo is a shell builtin

    Echo - echoes the text (example : echo Hello World!)
        $ echo Hello World!
        Hello World!

    web - open websites
        $ web facebook.com
        Accessing website / facebook.com
        (Opens Facebook.com)

    Prefix "." - executes a given file
        $.cmd
        Opening the file / C:\Windows\system32\cmd.EXE
        Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.26200.7171]
        (c) Microsoft Corporation. Kaikki oikeudet pidätetään.

        (cmd) C:\Users\-\tt-shell\tt-shell>
            
CODECRAFTERS STARTER CODE
            
    import sys
            
    def main():
        sys.stdout.write("$ ")
            
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
