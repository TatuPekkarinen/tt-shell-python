Minimal Python Shell

This project is a small command-line shell written in Python. It supports a few basic builtin commands and can also run executable files from the current directory. The goal is to provide a lightweight example of how a shell parses input and decides what to do with it.

Initially a codecrafters challenge I did without AI that includes a couple of differences to the initial challenge. Mostly made for me to tinker with like adding colorization making the file run commands as I actually need them to be alongside other commands that will be added.

programmed in Python version 3.14.0
